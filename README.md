# Convolutional-Neural-Networks-for-Image-classification

This project focuses on implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using the FashionMNIST dataset. The FashionMNIST dataset is a collection of Zalando's article images, consisting of 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples. Each example is a grayscale image with dimensions of 28x28 pixels, associated with one of the ten clothing classes.

The goal of this project is to develop an accurate image classifier that can identify different fashion items with high precision. CNNs are particularly effective for image classification tasks, as they can automatically learn relevant features from the input data.

The project starts by preprocessing the FashionMNIST dataset, which has already been conveniently split into training and testing sets. The CNN architecture is then constructed, involving multiple layers such as convolutional layers, max pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

Throughout the project, TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning library, is utilized to simplify the implementation of the CNN model. TensorFlow provides high-level abstractions and efficient computation for training deep neural networks.

## The key steps involved in this project include:
<ol>
<li>Preprocessing the FashionMNIST dataset, including loading and splitting the data into training and testing sets.</li>
<li>Building the CNN architecture by defining the network layers, including convolutional layers for feature extraction and max pooling layers for downsampling.</li>
<li>Training the CNN model using the training set and optimizing the model's parameters to minimize the classification error.</li>
<li>Evaluating the trained model's performance on the test set to assess its accuracy and generalization capabilities.</li>
<li>Fine-tuning and optimizing the CNN architecture to improve classification performance if necessary.</li>
</ol>
  
By completing this project, you will gain hands-on experience in implementing a CNN for image classification tasks and understand the fundamental concepts of deep learning and computer vision. Furthermore, you will have a functional image classifier that can accurately classify fashion items based on the FashionMNIST dataset.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different architectural configurations or additional preprocessing techniques to further enhance the classification performance.

Let's dive into the exciting world of CNNs and create a powerful image classifier with TensorFlow and the FashionMNIST dataset!
